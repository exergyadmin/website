At Exergy, we're building an industry where electric heaters mine Bitcoin, delivering warmth and rewards for homes and businesses. In Chapter 2 of my book, Bitcoin Mining Heat Reuse, titled "Hashrate Heating Across Different Scales," I explore how hashrate heaters work across different applications. Exergy focuses on residential and commercial/industrial heating systems—not mega-mining operations repurposing heat—because these scales maximize Bitcoin earnings, reduce utility costs, and align with our mission to hyper-decentralize Bitcoin's hashrate. Here's how Exergy's expertise in heat modeling, custom system design, skilled implementation, and remote monitoring makes hashrate heating work for you.

## Hashrate Heaters: Warming Spaces, Minting Bitcoin

Hashrate heaters deliver heat while mining Bitcoin, turning electricity into warmth and rewards. Exergy doesn't offer plug-and-play gadgets; we design fully integrated HVAC and hydronic systems tailored to your home or business. Our heat modeling ensures economic feasibility, our trained tradesmen handle precise installation, and our remote monitoring prevents downtime with passive data collection, keeping your heater—and Bitcoin mining—online.

## Why Exergy Focuses on Homes and Businesses

Exergy targets two key scales: residential/small businesses and industrial/commercial operations. These tiers are ideal for hashrate heating, offering unique benefits like network decentralization and high heat demand, unlike mega-mining operations where heat reuse is secondary to mining. Here's how we serve each.

### 1. Residential & Small Businesses (341–341,200 BTU/h)

Homeowners and small businesses, like a 2,000 sq ft home or a small retail shop, can heat spaces or water with systems producing 341–341,200 BTU/h (enough for a single room to an entire house). These setups hyper-decentralize Bitcoin's hashrate by spreading miners to countless locations, strengthening the network's security. High consumer energy prices and seasonal heating needs can slow payback, but Exergy's heat modeling predicts your Bitcoin earnings to ensure viability. We design integrated HVAC or hydronic systems—not just space heaters—for seamless performance. Our partner tradesmen, trained in this tech, handle installation, and remote monitoring ensures reliability.

### 2. Industrial, Manufacturing & Commercial (341,200–34,120,000 BTU/h)

This tier is perfect for hashrate heating, serving facilities like warehouses, apartment complexes, or manufacturing plants (e.g., a greenhouse or food processing plant) needing 341,200–34,120,000 BTU/h to heat large spaces or support year-round processes. Constant heat demand means higher duty cycles, leading to more Bitcoin rewards and faster payback. These sites are familiar with industrial hardware, making our custom HVAC or hydronic systems a natural fit. Exergy's feasibility analysis leverages commercial energy rates and tax incentives to optimize economics. Our trained tradesmen ensure precise installation, and remote monitoring maintains system uptime, slashing utility costs while minting Bitcoin.

## Why Not Mega-Miners?

Exergy is a heating company, not a mining operation. Mega-miners, with massive setups generating over 34,120,000 BTU/h, focus on Bitcoin mining and repurpose heat only when convenient, often in remote locations far from heat consumers. Their scale requires complex partnerships or thermodynamic cycles, which don't align with Exergy's mission of delivering integrated heating solutions for homes and businesses that prioritize warmth and Bitcoin rewards.

## Why Scale Matters for Heating

Each tier has unique economics and integration needs:

**Energy Pricing**: Homes face higher rates; commercial sites secure better deals. Exergy's feasibility studies ensure hashrate heating makes sense.

**Integration**: Residential setups need simple HVAC upgrades; commercial sites handle complex systems. Exergy designs tailored solutions.

**Economics**: Commercial sites benefit from tax write-offs, cheaper debt, and higher revenue-to-non-revenue asset ratios. Exergy optimizes payback.

**Duty Cycle**: Home heaters run intermittently (e.g., winter months); commercial sites often need heat year-round. Exergy's modeling predicts earnings based on your heat demand.

## Exergy's Edge

Exergy delivers Bitcoin-earning heaters for homes and businesses. Our heat modeling estimates savings and Bitcoin rewards, ensuring feasibility. We design integrated HVAC and hydronic systems, tailored to your scale, not off-the-shelf gadgets. Our preferred tradesmen, trained in this cutting-edge tech, implement with precision. Remote monitoring, powered by passive data, predicts issues to prevent downtime, keeping your heaters—and Bitcoin mining—online. Whether you're a homeowner hyper-decentralizing Bitcoin's hashrate or a business slashing utility costs, Exergy maximizes value.
