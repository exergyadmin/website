At Exergy, we’re not just heating homes and businesses—we’re building an industry that captures Bitcoin from electric heaters. In Chapter 1 of my book, Bitcoin Mining Heat Reuse, titled “Heat is a Product, Not a Problem,” I lay out nine reasons why hashrate heaters—electric heating systems that mine Bitcoin—are a no-brainer. These devices aren’t Bitcoin miners wasting heat; they’re heaters earning Bitcoin rewards. Here’s why this approach is inevitable for homeowners, businesses, and Bitcoin miners, aligning economic, practical, and ideological incentives.

## Hashrate Heaters: Heaters That Mine Bitcoin

Traditional heaters burn energy to keep you warm. Hashrate heaters do the same, but they also mine Bitcoin, turning every watt of heat into a chance to earn rewards. Every ASIC-powered heater converts electricity into heat while securing the Bitcoin network, delivering warmth and sats in one package (Bitcoin Mining Heat Reuse, Chapter 1). Here are the nine reasons to embrace this industry:

### 1. Savings on Heat

Heating costs hit everyone, but hashrate heaters turn that expense into revenue. These electric heaters mine Bitcoin while warming your home or business. The more heat you use, the more Bitcoin you earn, potentially offsetting costs or generating profit. Your heater becomes a financial asset.

### 2. Global Heat Demand

Heating eats up half of global energy—42,500 TWh annually for space and water heating, dwarfing Bitcoin’s 175 TWh. If just 1% of comfort heating came from hashrate heaters, it could add 1800 EH/s to the Bitcoin network, nearly tripling its hashrate with no extra energy. The market is enormous.

### 3. Utility Value of Mining

Bitcoin’s energy use gets flak, but as heaters, these devices are indispensable. Every home and business needs heat, and hashrate heaters deliver it while mining Bitcoin. This clear utility—keeping you warm—makes Bitcoin mining a practical necessity, shutting down critics.

### 4. Strengthened Network

More hashrate heaters mean more computing power securing Bitcoin. Higher total hashrate makes the network tougher to attack, ensuring Bitcoin’s longevity. By heating with these devices, you’re bolstering Bitcoin’s security.

### 5. Hashrate Decentralization

Big mining operations chase cheap power in remote areas, centralizing hashrate. Hashrate heaters spread Bitcoin mining to homes and businesses, even in high-cost energy zones, because heat utility offsets electricity prices. This hyper-decentralization makes Bitcoin more resilient and reduces mining pool control.

### 6. Non-KYC Sats

Privacy is king for Bitcoiners. Hashrate heaters deliver fresh, non-KYC Bitcoin straight to your wallet, untouched by exchange surveillance. It’s a quiet way to stack sats while paying your heating bill.

### 7. Reduced Local Emissions

Hashrate heaters are electric resistive heaters with zero local emissions—no combustion, no pollutants. Unlike gas heaters, they’re clean, appealing to anyone prioritizing pure air or ESG goals, all while earning Bitcoin.

### 8. Increased System Efficiency

Every watt in a hashrate heater pulls double duty: heating your space and mining Bitcoin. This dual-purpose efficiency maximizes energy use. For traditional miners, using heat adds value to what’s otherwise wasted, boosting sustainability.

### 9. Stability to Traditional Mining Economics

Large miners lose megawatts of heat. By using or selling it for industrial or local heating, they gain steady income. Unlike volatile Bitcoin rewards, heat revenue is consistent, giving miners an edge as subsidies shrink.

## The Future is Hashrate Heat

Hashrate heaters align incentives: save on heat, tap a huge market, add utility, strengthen Bitcoin, decentralize hashrate, secure private sats, cut emissions, boost efficiency, and stabilize mining economics. Thermodynamically, it’s undeniable—every watt of heat is a watt of Bitcoin mining potential.
