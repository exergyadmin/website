## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exergy-website.git
cd exergy-website
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install terser for production builds (required for Vite 3+)
```bash
npm install terser --save-dev
```

4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory with `serve.json` automatically copied for SPA routing.

### Serving Production Build

```bash
npm run serve
```

This serves the production build locally on port 3000 with proper SPA routing.

## Blog System

The blog system uses Markdown files with front matter for easy content management.

### Adding a New Blog Post

1. Create a new `.md` file in `src/blog-posts/`
2. Add front matter at the top:

```markdown
---
id: 'unique-post-id'
title: 'Your Blog Post Title'
excerpt: 'A compelling description of your blog post content.'
author: 'Author Name'
date: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
category: ['category1', 'category2']
image: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/...'
readTime: 'X min read'
---

Your blog content goes here in Markdown format.

## Subheading

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, [links](https://example.com), and images.

- List item 1
- List item 2
```
